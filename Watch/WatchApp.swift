/* Timetable on the Apple Watch: the day's classes over the sky outside, a
   widget for the Smart Stack that says what is on and what is next, and the
   reminders before each class.

   It stands on its own: it has a setup (WatchSetupView), and needs no
   phone to show the day. Where there is a phone that has been set up, the
   phone hands its profile across (DeviceLink), and whichever of the two was
   changed last is the one the watch shows. */
