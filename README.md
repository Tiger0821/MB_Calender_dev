# Timetable (iOS)

The userscript's timetable dock as an iPhone app with widgets, plus today's
date, a clock, a countdown to Taiwan's next national holiday, and the weather
outside as a pixel-art sky behind the page. One build serves the whole year
group: the first time it opens it asks who you are and which classes are
yours, and lays out your own timetable. Built with
the iOS 27 SDK (Xcode 27); runs on iOS 26 and later.

The userscript it comes from:
[ManageBac Reimagined](https://github.com/Tiger0821/ManageBac-Reimagined).

## Setup

The first time the app is opened it asks a few questions, one to a page:

1. **Your name.** It goes under the clock.
2. **Your form** — 11A or 11B. Each has its own timetable.
3. **Your classes.** The form's classes are sorted into sets that are on at
   the same time, so nobody takes two from one set: Maths (MAA HL, MAA SL,
   MAI HL), the two TOK groups, and so on. Each set is one page and one tap.
   Where a set isn't strictly one-or-the-other — in 11A, Eng B-1 and Eng Lit
   can be taken together, but neither with Eng A-2 — the page lets you pick
   more than one, and picking a class drops any that clash with it.
4. **SL revision**, if any of the classes you picked has a revision class.
5. **Your clubs.** The timetable only says "Service Clubs" and "Academic
   Clubs"; put in what yours are called, with a room and a teacher if you
   like, and a different club for Week 2 if yours alternate. Or leave them
   blank.

Guidance, Weekly Alignment and the clubs are on everyone's timetable and are
never asked about. Any period before 16:05 with none of your classes in it is
shown as IB Core.

Tap your name under the clock to go through it again, already filled in, and
change anything. Changing form keeps the choices the two forms share.

None of the sets are written into the app. `Timetable.catalog(for:)` works
them out from the rows: two classes clash when they are on at the same time
on some day, a class that clashes with nothing is everyone's, and the rest
fall into sets of classes linked by clashes. So when the school changes the
options, the questions follow.

## The app

- Your name and form, then today's date and the time to the second.
- The class running now (or the next one), with the minutes left.
- The next national holiday: whole days while it is more than a day away, then
  hours, minutes and seconds. The three after it are listed underneath.
- A picker for any of the ten days in the cycle, and that day's timetable.
- The weather outside, painted behind it all as pixel art — see
  [Weather](#weather).

The four boxes — class, holiday, day picker, timetable — can be put in any
order: touch and hold one until it lifts, drag it, and the others slide out of
its way. Hold it near the top or bottom of the screen and the page scrolls
under it, so a box can travel further than one screen. The order is remembered
(`boxOrder` in the app's defaults). A swipe still scrolls the page and a tap
still picks a day; only a held finger lifts a box.

Nothing else is on the page. **Settings** is a page of its own off the
right-hand edge: swipe in from that edge, or tap the gear beside the clock,
and it slides across; swipe back from the left edge, or tap the arrow, and it
goes. It has the Lock Screen switch, your form and classes, a way to put the
boxes back as they came, and where the timetable, the holidays and the
weather come from.

## Widgets

- **Now & Next** — small, medium, and three Lock Screen sizes (inline,
  circular, rectangular). The class running now with a live countdown and
  progress bar, and what's next. Before school, after it and at weekends it
  shows the first class of the next school day instead.
- **Today** — large. The whole day as the dock lays it out: finished blocks
  greyed back, and the current one filling from left to right across its row
  as it runs, with its countdown.
- **Holiday Countdown** — small, medium, and the three Lock Screen sizes. Days
  to the next national holiday, switching to a live hours:minutes:seconds
  countdown once it is under a day away. The medium size adds today's date and
  a running clock.

Add them by touching and holding the Home Screen or Lock Screen → Edit →
Add Widget → search "Timetable".

The timetable is built into the app, so the widgets need no network and no
account. Whose timetable to show they read from the profile setup saves, which
the app and the widgets share through an app group; until setup has been done
they say to open the app. Each widget lays out a timeline with an entry at every bell through
the next two school days; the countdowns in between are drawn by the system.

## On the Lock Screen

Switch on **Show the day's classes** in Settings and the school day goes up
as a Live Activity: on the Lock Screen, the class you're in, the time left in
it, a bar filling as it runs down, and what's next; in the Dynamic Island,
the class's name and the minutes left of it ("CS 14 min"). Before the first
bell it shows the first class and, for the last two hours, counts down to it.
It changes with every bell by itself.

The island counts to the end of the class, so through a double period it is
one countdown; the Lock Screen counts to the end of the period. In a short
break the island names the class to come and the time it starts.

On a paired Apple Watch the Live Activity shows in the Smart Stack as the
day's name and a countdown of how long school has left, and no more. (The
phone's panels can't be used there, and nor can a bar that fills as the day
goes by: on the watch a bar run by the clock is drawn finished whatever the
time is, so the masks hide nothing and a bar for the day was full at half
past two. A countdown is text, and is the one thing that moves.) What is on
now and what is next is the watch app's own widget — see "On the Apple
Watch" below.

The watch is sent the drawing when the day's Live Activity starts, so a new
build shows there from the next start — turn the Lock Screen switch off and
on in Settings to see it sooner.

- **It goes up at 06:00** on school days (the time can be changed). The app
  books the next school morning with the system each time it is opened, and
  the system starts it at that time without the app running. Opening the app
  once between school days keeps that going.
- **Without opening the app at all:** the app offers Shortcuts a **Start
  Classes** action. In Shortcuts: Automation › New › Time of Day › pick the
  time and days › Run Immediately › Start Classes.
- **How long it stays:** iOS takes a Live Activity out of the Dynamic Island
  after 8 hours and off the Lock Screen after 12. One that goes up at 06:00 is
  in the island until 14:00 and on the Lock Screen until 18:00.
- **Swiping it away** clears it until the app is next opened. The switch is
  how to turn it off.
- With the screen dimmed, iOS shows a countdown's minutes and leaves the
  seconds as dashes.

### How it changes by itself

A Live Activity can't be given a timeline the way a widget can: what it shows
only changes when the app updates it or a server pushes to it, and during the
school day there is neither. So the whole day goes in when it starts, and the
view is every block's panel stacked up, each hidden behind a mask that the
clock opens — a progress bar set to run out at the block's first second, which
is one of the two things the system will animate by itself. `TimeSwitch` and
`Curtain` in `Widget/ClassLiveActivity.swift` are that; the comments there say
what it took to make it hold. The panels are nested, each behind the masks of
all the ones before it, because a closed mask is not quite opaque and side by
side sixteen of them let a ghost of the afternoon through.

The limit to design within: the system saves a Live Activity's drawing to a
file and silently shows nothing if it is over 2,000,000 bytes (1,953 KB), and
what fills it is countdowns (about 40 KB each) and bars. iOS 27 saves the
same drawing about an eighth larger than iOS 26, so it is the one to measure
on. For 11B's ten days, measured on 6 Oct 2026:

| | iOS 26.5 | iOS 27.0 |
|---|---|---|
| lightest day (13 blocks) | 1,223 KB | 1,436 KB |
| fullest day (16 blocks) | 1,457 KB | 1,734 KB |

A day of more than sixteen blocks drops the island's minutes, which is some
300 KB lighter (`affordsMinutes`). Anything added to the Live Activity should be weighed the
same way before it is trusted: the saved file is the `.activity-archive` under
the simulator's `Containers/Data/PluginKitPlugin/…/SystemData/com.apple.chrono/activities`.

The minutes in the island are a countdown with its seconds clipped off
(`MinutesLeft`). A text formatted to read "32 min" is not kept up to date in
a Live Activity; a countdown is.

To try it without waiting for a bell, run a debug build with `LIVE_TEST` set
in the scheme's environment: a number starts a made-up day with blocks that
many seconds long; `day` starts the next real school day now; `size:3` starts
the day three days from now as it would be booked, to weigh it.

## On the Apple Watch

The phone app carries a watch app with it (`Watch/`, and its widget in
`WatchWidget/`), and the watch app stands on its own as well: it is marked as
running independently of the phone's, and has a setup of its own, so it shows
the day on a watch whose phone has never had Timetable opened.

- **Setup** on the wrist (`WatchSetupView.swift`) is the phone's with what
  wants a keyboard taken out: your form, each set of classes that are on at
  the same time, and any SL revision. It comes up the first time, and again
  from "Change classes" under the day. Your name and what your clubs are
  called are asked only on the phone, and are kept when the classes are
  changed on the watch.
- **With a phone that has been set up too**, the phone hands its profile
  across whenever the app is opened or the classes change, with the time it
  came out of setup. The watch takes it unless its own is the newer, so the
  watch shows whichever was changed last. What is chosen on the watch is not
  handed back to the phone.
- **The app** is the phone's page cut down to what a wrist has room for: each
  class with the time it starts and its room, the breaks between, the class
  that is on outlined with its time left, and the same pixel sky behind. No
  date, no clock, no teachers.
- **The widget** (Smart Stack › Edit › add Timetable) says the class that is
  on with its room and the time it has left, and the class after it with its
  room. From two hours before the first bell it says "Good morning" — in
  pixels, like the sky (`PixelText.swift` draws the letters as squares) —
  over the first class, a small countdown to it, and the class after; for the
  last half hour the countdown takes the greeting's line and is the largest
  thing on the tile. Over the same hours, and until the last bell, it tells
  the Smart Stack it is worth bringing to the top. It is a widget and not
  the Live Activity because a widget is given a timeline, and so can change
  at every bell.

## Reminders

Fifteen minutes and five minutes before each class starts, a notification
says what it is and where ("CS in 5 min · 5F HS3"). A double period is
announced once. The switch is in Settings.

Once Timetable has been opened on the watch, the watch sends them itself, so
they tap the wrist whatever the phone is doing, and the phone stands down so
nothing is said twice. Without the watch app the phone sends them, and iOS
passes them to the watch while the phone is locked. They are laid down some
four school days ahead (the system keeps 64 for an app) and renewed each time
either app is opened.

## Run it

Open `ManageBacTimetable.xcodeproj`, pick a simulator, and press Run.

On your own iPhone: Xcode → Settings → Accounts, sign in with your Apple ID,
then select the project → each of the two targets → Signing & Capabilities →
Team. Both targets have the App Groups capability, which Xcode registers for
your team the first time it signs them.

Building it under a different Apple ID — a classmate building their own copy —
means changing the bundle id `com.tigercho.ManageBacTimetable` (and the
widget's `.Widget` id under it) to something of their own, and the app group
with it, in three places: `Profile.group` in `Shared/Profile.swift`, and the
two `.entitlements` files in `App/` and `Widget/`. The group id has to start
with `group.` and be the same in all three, or the widgets won't see the
profile.

## When the school changes the timetable

```bash
python3 Tools/update_timetable.py
```

That reads the school's published Prime Timetable and rewrites
`Shared/TimetableData.swift` with every lesson of each form, one row each:
subject, day, start, end, staff, room. Build again and everyone's timetable,
and the questions setup asks, follow the new rows. To add a form, add its name
to `FORMS` at the top of the script.

Cards the school has left off the grid (they have no day) are not lessons and
are left out.

## Keeping it in step with the userscript

The timetable logic in `Shared/Timetable.swift` is a port of the userscript's
TIMETABLE section, and for the same classes lays out the same ten days. The
differences are deliberate:

- The userscript has one person's classes written into it; here they come
  from the profile, so `TT_MINE` and `TT_CLUBS` have no constants to match.
- The timetable's "G: Agency [EE, CAS, CC]" block is shown as "Guidance" (see
  `Timetable.displayName`).
- The rows are read from the school's feed by the script above. The
  userscript's `TT_RAW` counts cards with no day as Week 1 Monday, which puts
  two lessons on that day that the published timetable doesn't have (a Bus Man
  at 16:15 and a Chinese revision at 15:40); `TT_SKIP` was there to hide one
  of them. Neither is in the rows here, so there is nothing to skip.

| Userscript   | Here                                            |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `TT_RAW`     | `Shared/TimetableData.swift`, from the script   |
| `TT_MINE`    | `Profile.subjects`, picked in setup             |
| `TT_SKIP`    | not needed                                      |
| `TT_CLUBS`   | `Profile.clubs`, typed in setup                 |
| `TT_ANCHOR`  | `Timetable.anchor`                              |
| `TT_SOURCE`  | `Timetable.source`                              |

Subject colours are in `Shared/SubjectStyle.swift`.

## Holidays

`Shared/Holidays.swift` lists Taiwan's national holidays from the government
office calendars for 2026 (民國115年) and 2027 (116年), from National Day 2026
through New Year's Day 2028, with the weekday given off when one lands on a
weekend. The lunar festivals move every year, so add the 2028 dates when that
calendar is published — after the last entry the countdown simply disappears.

The countdown runs to midnight at the start of the holiday itself (not the
substitute day off), in the phone's own time zone. The timetable does not know
about holidays: classes are still shown on a day off.

## Weather

The page's background is the sky as it is outside, the way the Weather app
does it, drawn as pixel art: a sun with rays or a crescent moon, stars,
clouds drifting with the wind, rain that leans with it, snow, fog, lightning,
and a line of hills along the bottom. Under the date is a strip of open sky
for it to show in, with the temperature, the conditions, the place and the
day's high and low on glass in its corner.

- The weather is from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), which needs no
  key and no account. It is looked up when the app opens and every ten
  minutes while it stays open, and the last reading is kept for three hours so
  the sky is there at once next time.
- It is for where the phone is, so the app asks to use the location while it
  is open. The position is rounded to about a kilometre before it is sent.
  Refuse, or be offline, and there is no weather: the page keeps its plain
  background and nothing else changes.
- Sunrise and sunset come with the weather, so the sky turns from day through
  twilight to night on its own between readings.
- Over a sky the page is always in its dark colours, since every sky is dark
  at the top where the date is.
- With Reduce Motion on, the sky is painted once and left still.
- Nothing is an image file. `PixelSky.swift` paints each frame into a small
  grid of pixels, fifteen times a second, and scales it up unsmoothed.

To see a sky without waiting for the weather, launch with the argument
`-demoWeather` and a sky and a time of day — `-demoWeather thunderstorm-night`,
say. The skies are `clear`, `mostlyClear`, `partlyCloudy`, `overcast`, `fog`,
`drizzle`, `rain`, `heavyRain`, `snow` and `thunderstorm`; the times are `day`,
`twilight` and `night`. In Xcode that is Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run →
Arguments.

The widgets do not show the weather and still use no network.

## Layout

- `Shared/` — the timetable and its styling; compiled into both targets.
  `TimetableData.swift` is the rows for each form, `Profile.swift` is whose
  timetable it is, and `Timetable.swift` lays one person's fortnight out.
  `ClassActivity.swift` is a day as the Live Activity carries it.
- `App/` — the app: date and clock, Now card, holiday card, the ten-day
  picker, the day's timetable. `SetupView.swift` is setup.
  `ReorderableStack.swift` is the hold-and-drag reordering, edge scrolling
  included. `SettingsPanel.swift` is the settings page and the edge swipe that
  brings it in. `ClassActivityManager.swift` starts and books the Live
  Activity, `LockScreenSettings.swift` is its switch, and
  `ClassActivityIntent.swift` is the Shortcuts action.
- `Tools/` — `update_timetable.py`, which rebuilds the rows from the school's
  published timetable, and `draw_icon.swift`, which draws the app's icon (a
  pixel owl in a red bow tie, on white, shaded and lifted in layers) into both asset catalogues.
- `Widget/` — the widget extension: the widgets, and in
  `ClassLiveActivity.swift` the Live Activity's views.
- `Common/` — what the phone app and the watch app share but the widgets do
  not: `Weather.swift` and `PixelSky.swift`, `ClassReminders.swift`,
  `Picking.swift`, which is what a pick in setup does to the profile on
  either, and `DeviceLink.swift`, which carries the profile from phone to
  watch.
- `Watch/` and `WatchWidget/` — the watch app and its Smart Stack widget.
  `Shared/ClassActivity.swift` is left out of both, since there is no
  ActivityKit on the watch.

The folders are synchronised groups, so a file dropped into one in Finder or
Xcode is picked up by that folder's targets without editing the project.
